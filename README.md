# The Leuven Art Personalized Image Set (LAPIS)
Dataset from "LAPIS: a novel dataset for personalized image aesthetic assessment".
Accepted at [CVEU](https://cveu.github.io/), a workshop of CVPR 2025.

## Why LAPIS?
1. LAPIS is the **first** dataset with art images that is suitable for personalized image aesthetic assessment(PIAA)
2. LAPIS contains **rich** image and personal attributes to improve (understanding of) predictions
4. LAPIS establishes a new standard for **data-quality** in the field, as it was meticulously curated in collaboration with art historians

Visualisation of the types of data in LAPIS. All images have metadata (title, artist) and image attributes. Images are rated by multiple users on their aesthetic appeal. For each user, we have a set of personal attributes
